/// Define the ustring class, unique strings with efficient storage and
/// very fast copy and comparison.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \class ustring
///
/// A ustring is an alternative to char* or std::string for storing
/// strings, in which the character sequence is unique (allowing many
/// speed advantages for assignment, equality testing, and inequality
/// testing).
///
/// The implementation is that behind the scenes there is a hash set of
/// allocated strings, so the characters of each string are unique.  A
/// ustring itself is a pointer to the characters of one of these canonical
/// strings.  Therefore, assignment and equality testing is just a single
/// 32- or 64-bit int operation, the only mutex is when a ustring is
/// created from raw characters, and the only malloc is the first time
/// each canonical ustring is created.
///
/// The internal table also contains a std::string version and the length
/// of the string, so converting a ustring to a std::string (via
/// ustring::string()) or querying the number of characters (via
/// ustring::size() or ustring::length()) is extremely inexpensive, and does
/// not involve creation/allocation of a new std::string or a call to
/// strlen.
///
/// We try very hard to completely mimic the API of std::string,
/// including all the constructors, comparisons, iterations, etc.  Of
/// course, the charaters of a ustring are non-modifiable, so we do not
/// replicate any of the non-const methods of std::string.  But in most
/// other ways it looks and acts like a std::string and so most templated
/// algorthms that would work on a "const std::string &" will also work
/// on a ustring.
///
/// Usage guidelines:
///
/// Compared to standard strings, ustrings have several advantages:
///
///   - Each individual ustring is very small -- in fact, we guarantee that
///     a ustring is the same size and memory layout as an ordinary char*.
///   - Storage is frugal, since there is only one allocated copy of each
///     unique character sequence, throughout the lifetime of the program.
///   - Assignment from one ustring to another is just copy of the pointer;
///     no allocation, no character copying, no reference counting.
///   - Equality testing (do the strings contain the same characters) is
///     a single operation, the comparison of the pointer.
///   - Memory allocation only occurs when a new ustring is construted from
///     raw characters the FIRST time -- subsequent constructions of the
///     same string just finds it in the canonial string set, but doesn't
///     need to allocate new storage.  Destruction of a ustring is trivial,
///     there is no de-allocation because the canonical version stays in
///     the set.  Also, therefore, no user code mistake can lead to
///     memory leaks.
///
/// But there are some problems, too.  Canonical strings are never freed
/// from the table.  So in some sense all the strings "leak", but they
/// only leak one copy for each unique string that the program ever comes
/// across.  Also, creation of unique strings from raw characters is more
/// expensive than for standard strings, due to hashing, table queries,
/// and other overhead.
///
/// On the whole, ustrings are a really great string representation
///   - if you tend to have (relatively) few unique strings, but many
///     copies of those strings;
///   - if the creation of strings from raw characters is relatively
///     rare compared to copying or comparing to existing strings;
///   - if you tend to make the same strings over and over again, and
///     if it's relatively rare that a single unique character sequence
///     is used only once in the entire lifetime of the program;
///   - if your most common string operations are assignment and equality
///     testing and you want them to be as fast as possible;
///   - if you are doing relatively little character-by-character assembly
///     of strings, string concatenation, or other "string manipulation"
///     (other than equality testing).
///
/// ustrings are not so hot
///   - if your program tends to have very few copies of each character
///     sequence over the entire lifetime of the program;
///   - if your program tends to generate a huge variety of unique
///     strings over its lifetime, each of which is used only a short
///     time and then discarded, never to be needed again;
///   - if you don't need to do a lot of string assignment or equality
///     testing, but lots of more complex string manipulation.
